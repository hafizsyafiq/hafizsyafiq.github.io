  I created this design using the Canva and Adobe Photoshop applications. Canva is used as a practical tool for drafting initial design concepts, thanks to its wide range of templates, graphic elements and easy-to-access features. Meanwhile, Adobe Photoshop is used to perfect design details, such as image processing, color adjustments, and adding special effects that require a high level of precision. The combination of these two applications allows me to create attractive, functional and professional designs.
